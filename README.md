# Bank Loan Repayment Analysis

## Problem Statement
To analyze and understand the factors influencing loan repayment success, focusing on borrower demographics, loan characteristics, and payment behaviors to identify patterns in "good" vs. "bad" loans.

## Need and Objective
The primary need for this analysis is to enable banks and lending institutions to gain insights into loan repayment dynamics. By identifying key factors that contribute to timely payments, such as income level, loan purpose, and installment size, banks can better assess borrower risk and improve loan decision-making processes. The objective is to uncover trends that impact loan repayment success, allowing for more informed strategies in lending, risk management, and customer profiling.
